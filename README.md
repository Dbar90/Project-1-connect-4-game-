# Welcome to my Connect Four Game.
This is my first project in my GA Software Engineer Immersive course! The game I chose for this project was Connect Four.

## Game Description
My game is called Connect Four. It is a game for two players who would like to play Connect Four locally on their desktop. Once the game is started it will keep track of which player's turn it is. Once a player connects four of their corresponding colored "chips" in a row they win! The winner of the game will be displayed once the game is over. To start a new game all you have to do it click the button "New Game", which is how you start the game to begin with. If you need a refresher on what the rules of the game are or how to play just give the "About Game" button a click!

## Below you will find a few example pics of the game in action!
